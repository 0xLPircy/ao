# Examples Archive

These projects were built using pre-1.0 version of `ao`, during active development of the `ao` Protocol. They are no longer accurate representations of the `ao` Protocol, but still kept for posterity.

These projects should not be considered accurate representations of the 1.0 `ao` patterns.

Reference other examples in this repo or the [`ao` Cookbook](https://cookbook_ao.arweave.dev) for `1.0` guides and examples.
